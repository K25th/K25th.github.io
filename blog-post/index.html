                where the poor scrape by under the shadow of the 
                rich who live a sumptuous life, 
                simply casting their garbage off the side, into the abyss.

                and his wrongful conviction leads to an unimaginable 
                punishment—exile off the edge, with the rest of the trash Down 
                on the surface, the cast-off waste of humanity 
                has bred vicious monsters, and if Rudo wants to have any 
                hope of discovering the truth and seeking vengeance against 
                those who cast him into Hell,he will have to master a new power 
                and join a group known as the Cleaners 
                who battle the hulking trash beasts of the Pit!
