            One Piece Film: Red is about a world-famous singer 
            named Uta who holds her first-ever live concert, 
            which also serves as a front for a misguided plan to create a 
            new world free of suffering. 
            The Straw Hat Pirates, led by Luffy, attend the concert and 
            discover that Uta is his former childhood friend and the daughter of
            "Red-Haired" Shanks. Uta plans to trap the world in an 
            alternate reality using her "otherworldly" voice, and 
            the pirates must stop her, while Shanks 
            also plays a prominent role in the story.
